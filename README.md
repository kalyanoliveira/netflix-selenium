# netflixselenium

Welcome! This is just a simple project where I automate basic Netflix functionality via Selenium

# Setup

The first thing you'll need to do is create a my_secrets.py file in the root directory. This file should contain the following lines:

MY_CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = "type your chromedriver path here"
MY_EMAIL = "type your email here"
MY_PASSWORD = "type your password here"
PREFERRED_USER = ""

In MY_EMAIL, you should type the email for your Netflix login
In MY_PASSWORD, type the password you use during your Netflix login

If you have multiple users (for instance, if you share your Netflix account with other people), you can specify a PREFERRED_USER.
Make sure to type your preferred user's name as accurately as possible, as it is case-sensitive
If you do not share your Netflix account with anyone else, you can leave PREFERRED_USER as is
Next, we'll look into the chrome driver setup.

## For Linux

Notice that I did this entire process on an Ubuntu distribution of Linux, (it was actually the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)). Though that should't really matter, I've definitely ran into issues whilst trying to setup the dependencies for this project. Regardless; just follow the commands below, and you *should* be fine.

mkdir tmp

cd tmp

mkdir driver

cd driver

sudo apt install wget # If you don't have it already

wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.37/chromedriver_linux64.zip

unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip

sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver

sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/chromedriver

sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver


Make sure your installation worked with

chromedriver --version

If you had previously used chromedriver, run this and make sure the output is "/usr/bin/chromedriver"
which chromedriver

For Linux, you do have to have Chrome installed. Assuming you completed the steps above, this can be done via:

cd tmp

mkdir chrome

cd chrome

sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade

wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

sudo apt-get install -f


Then type google-chrome to see if it all works

Once you have your chromedriver and chrome installed, you can change the MY_CHROMEDRIVER_PATH of the my_secrets.py file to "/usr/bin/chromedriver"

## For Windows

Though I never attempted to do this in Windows, theoretically all you need to do is to download the correct version of the driver from this website (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

To know which version you need, type chrome://version/ into your Chrome browser (assuming you have that installed. If you don't, install it). Should be the first line you see in that page.

Then place the downloaded chromedriver into a folder you like, and copy the path of that folder into MY_CHROMEDRIVER_PATH, in the my_secrets.py file. Make sure you add an "r" before the string, so it'll be something like

r'C:\Users\user\Downloads\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe'

## For MacOS

## Creating a virtual environment and installing selenium

The only piece missing from this dependency puzzle is the selenium package. You can easily download it via

pip install selenium

that is, assuming you have python and pip. 
It is also good practice to create a python virtual environment, and only install selenium in that environment. You can create one via

python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

though you do need to install something in apt in order to do that. I will add that to this README.md once done.

# Usage

In main.py you'll find a sample of what is currently possible with this project.

We start by importing a Netflix() class and creating an object of that class.
Then, you should be able to do n.watch("query"), and if all is set up correctly selenium will open a new instance of Chrome, login to Netflix, search for your query, and play the best match for it. Try running "python main.py" to see it for yourself.

Have fun!
